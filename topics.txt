Good solution overall, we'll go over minor details tomorrow. However, the main point of scripts in general is to automate routine tasks. So I suggest that the script will do things automatically when run by user, instead of just loading functions into memory and allowing user to utilize them like it does now.

What we want to achieve is that when user runs the script with PowerShell, it would automatically open a file/ask user for input/update the file.

If you want additional practice, you can use this existing script as a function library or even a module (see dot-sourcing and Import-Module) and utilize functions in a new one, that will run commands automatically.Oh, and consider replacing FINDSTR with Select-String.



When script is run
1) ask what sort of action should be performed
2) ask for input and automaticly perform action
